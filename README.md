# Webshop - Fredagsmys #

A basic webshop website made in collaboration with MÃ¤rta Ballardini [/ballardinimarta](https://github.com/ballardinimarta)

This website was made as a homework assignment for our courses in vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, as well as an exercise on collaborating with other developers. It took us about a week to build everything from scratch.

**Installation:**
 - Download the .zip file containing the code, unzip and open the file
   in your preferred code editor.
 - In your root directory, open up your terminal and enter the command `npm install` to set up the *node_modules* folder and download all the dependencies. This might take a couple of minutes.
 - In your terminal, type the command `gulp` to run the Browsersync plugin and start surfing the website.
